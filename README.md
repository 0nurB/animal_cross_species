## Abstract

Motivation: Protein--protein interactions (PPIs) underpin a wide range of biological functions in living organisms; however, their experimental identification is often time-consuming and costly. In this context, artificial intelligence–based models have been developed to predict such interactions.
Results: We propose a new pre-trained PPI prediction model specifically designed for animals, built upon a novel training dataset that captures interaction patterns across a diverse set of animal species. In addition, based on sequence alignment metrics, we introduce a new measure termed the representation score, which enables the stratification of protein pairs into categories according to their similarity to the training data. This stratification allows us to distinguish scenarios in which the model is expected to achieve higher or lower predictive performance. The proposed model attains an overall accuracy of 95% for animal PPIs and consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art pre-trained models by margins ranging from 4% to 17% accuracy across different representation score categories. Finally, the model is evaluated on PPIs datasets comprising 2,574 distinct species, including animals, fungi, plants, bacteria, and archaea.
